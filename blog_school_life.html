    <h1 class="sch_lf_h1">My school life</h1>

    <p class="sch_lf_p">I have just started 7th grade and everything is going well right now. Unlike last year, this year, 
        we have been given lockers so it makes things more easier as we can now store our 
        belongings there instead
        of having to carry it home everyday. ALso, unlike last year, this year we have to learn Spanish 
        and there
        is a whole new subject for that. Right now, the normal classes have Spanish 2 times a week and the SP
        (honors classes) have Spanish 3 times a week, moving on to 8th grade, the normal classes will have
        Spanish 3 times a week and the SP classes will have Spanish 4 times a week and the SP class
        will also get a Spanish state test (a state test is basically like a state-wide test that determines
        how good you are and highschools also check this but it doesn't count toward your school grade). I'm 
        currently enjoying 7th grade, I've made a few friends and I sometimes go out with them to play or just
        relax at the park or at my house or their house.
